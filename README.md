Pig Dice Game.......................(Note:-Included flow chart)........................................
Introduction..........................................
The Pig Dice Game is a simple dice game where the objective is to score a certain number of points before your opponent. Each player takes turns rolling a standard six-sided die and accumulates points based on the rolls. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all their accumulated points for that turn.

Rules of the Game.......................................
Each player takes turns to roll a die as many times as they want during their turn.
The number rolled on the die is added to the player's current turn score.
If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose all points accumulated during that turn.
The player can choose to "Hold," which means they add their turn score to their total score, and it becomes the opponent's turn.
The first player to reach a predefined winning score (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.
